# NestJS Common Module Components
## Controllers

### health.controller.ts

**Purpose:** Provides endpoints for health checks of the application.

**Functionality:**
- Typically exposes a `/health` endpoint.
- Returns the status of the application and its dependencies (e.g., database connection).

**Importance:** Essential for monitoring and ensuring the application is running correctly.

## Pipes

### joi-validation.pipe.ts

**Purpose:** Implements input validation using the Joi library.

**Functionality:**
- Validates incoming request data (body, query parameters, etc.) against predefined schemas.
- Throws exceptions for invalid data, preventing it from reaching the route handlers.

**Importance:** Ensures data integrity and security by validating input before processing.

## Interceptors

### log.interceptor.ts

**Purpose:** Implements logging functionality for requests and responses.

**Functionality:**
- Intercepts incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- Logs relevant information such as request method, URL, response status, and execution time.

**Importance:** Provides valuable insights for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

## Providers

### config.provider.ts

**Purpose:** Manages application configuration.

**Functionality:**
- Loads and provides access to environment-specific configuration (e.g., from .env files).
- Often uses NestJS's ConfigModule for centralized configuration management.

**Importance:** Allows for easy configuration changes across different environments (development, production, etc.).

### logger.service.ts

**Purpose:** Provides a centralized logging service.

**Functionality:**
- Implements methods for different log levels (info, error, debug, etc.).
- May integrate with external logging services or format logs for better readability.

**Importance:** Ensures consistent logging across the application, aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring.

### prisma.provider.ts

**Purpose:** Manages the Prisma ORM database connection.

**Functionality:**
- Initializes and provides the Prisma client to other parts of the application.
- Handles database connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect).

**Importance:** Centralizes database connection management, ensuring efficient use of database resources.

## Security

### Various Guards

**Purpose:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Types might include:**
- **guest.guard.ts:** Allows access to public routes.
- **restricted.guard.ts:** Protects routes that require authentication.
- **health.guard.ts:** Specifically for protecting health check endpoints.

**Functionality:**
- Intercept requests and check for necessary credentials or permissions.
- Prevent unauthorized access to protected routes.

**Importance:** Critical for maintaining application security and controlling access to resources.

## Spec

### basic-unit-test.spec.ts

**Purpose:** Contains unit tests for the common module components.

**Functionality:**
- Tests individual units of code in isolation (e.g., functions, classes).
- Ensures that each component of the common module works as expected.

**Importance:** Maintains code quality, catches bugs early, and facilitates refactoring.

These components collectively provide a robust foundation for the application, handling cross-cutting concerns like configuration, logging, security, and data validation. They are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.
